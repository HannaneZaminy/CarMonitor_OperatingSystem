# CarMonitor_OperatingSystem
I tried to solve a simulated traffic problem to minimize the air pollution caused by cars. This means that by receiving information about cars' pollution and a map of the city as well as using monitors, the program tries to find the best schedule for cars to move across the streets. The monitors are implemented from scratch.
